WebAppWalker
============

WebAppWalker is a framework for automated UI-level testing of web applications. The framework generates sequences of events, such as clicks on DOM elements, scrolling, and filling forms. We have instantiated the WebAppWalker framework into **EventBreak**, an approach to analyze the responsiveness of web applications through performance-guided test generation. Details on EventBreak are described in this paper:

This repository provides the source code of our implementation. The easiest way to experiment with EventBreak is to use this [Virtualbox VM image](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pradel/EventBreak_OOPSLA_Artifact.tar.gz), where EventBreak, all its requirements, and several benchmark applications are pre-installed. The image contains a file README_EventBreak_Artifact.txt with instructions on how to use it.
